      <h3>The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
      <p>
        The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of three volumes in The Lord of the Rings, an epic set in the fictional world of
        Middle-earth. The Lord of the Rings is an entity named Sauron, the Dark Lord, who long ago lost the One Ring that
        contains much of his power. His overriding desire is to reclaim the Ring and use it to enslave all of Middle-earth.

      <h3>The Two Towers</h3>
      <p>
        The Two Towers opens with the disintegration of the Fellowship, as Merry and Pippin are taken captive by Orcs after the
        death of Boromir in battle. The Orcs, having heard a prophecy that a Hobbit will bear a Ring that gives universal power
        to its owner, wrongly think that Merry and Pippin are the Ring-bearers.

      <h3>The Return of the King</h3>
      <p>
        The Return of the King, the third and final volume in The Lord of the Rings, opens as Gandalf and Pippin ride east to
        the city of Minas Tirith in Gondor, just after parting with King Théoden and the Riders of Rohan at the end of The Two
        Towers. In Minas Tirith, Gandalf and Pippin meet Denethor, the city’s Steward, or ruler, who clearly dislikes Gandalf.
        Pippin offers Denethor his sword in service to Gondor, out of gratitude for the fact that Denethor’s son Boromir gave
        his life for the hobbits earlier in the quest.
